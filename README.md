# Hangman-Game

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

Here, you have three files named main1.py, hangman_art1.py, hangman_words1.py.
main1.py is the starting file of the game.

I gave some words in hangman_words1 file for reference.

and in hangman_art1 file, I added hangman logo and stages of lives
